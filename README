# Postural Perturbation Simulation Code

This MATLAB code generates simulations for a postural perturbation task, investigating the impact of delay estimation errors on motor control.

## Overview

This code simulates a postural perturbation task with varying perturbation magnitudes and conditions. The simulations focus on the accurate or underestimation of the delay in the state estimator. The results from this code are used to generate Figure 4 in the associated paper.

## Simulations

The simulations are performed using the LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) framework, integrating state and motor commands over a specified delay interval.

### Main Script: `runSim.m`

- Defines simulation parameters.
- Runs simulations for both "Healthy Controls" (HC) and "Essential Tremor" (ET) conditions.
- Generates arm angle, angular velocity, control signal, and Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots.

### Integration Function: `integrate.m`

- Integrates state and motor commands over the delay interval.
- Takes into account proportional errors in delay parameters.
- Can include noise in the delay estimation.

### Simulation Function: `simulation.m`

- Simulates a single movement using the LQG framework.
- Accounts for delay errors, perturbation magnitude, and scaling factors for matrix estimations.

## Files

- `runSim.m`: Main script to run simulations and generate figures.

- `simulation.m`: Function for simulating a single movement in the LQG framework.

## Usage

1. Set simulation parameters in `runSim.m`.
2. Run the script to perform simulations and generate figures.
